To build the solid leaf bsp

To recover connectivity from the bsp.

for each split plane create a polygon that has been clipped by the parent nodes. If the node is
on the back side of the plane, flip the plane normal (and the distance ?)

Send this plane down the subtree, if it straddles or is coincident with the plane, send it
down both sides. This is because the connectivity is within the convex subspace created by the
original split plane. Tag this polygon with the id of the node, even after it splits.

Search all leaf nodes for leaf nodes that contain the polygon with the same id. If it exists
it's possible that a portal will exist between the sub spaces.

Clip this potential portal by all the planes that form both leaf nodes, ie: clip from leaf node
to root through parent nodes. If the polygon survices this process, a link exists and the shape of
the polygon is the shape of the portal through which the subspaces are connected.
